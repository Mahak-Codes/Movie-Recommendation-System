# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This system provides personalized movie recommendations based on various attributes of movies.

## Overview

Our Movie Recommendation System suggests movies to users based on the attributes of movies they have liked or rated positively. It analyzes similarities between movies in terms of genres, keywords, cast, and crew to provide relevant recommendations.

## Features

- **Movie Database:** Comprehensive database of movies containing information such as title, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- **Attribute Processing:** Text attributes like overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew are processed to extract meaningful information.
- **Vectorization:** Conversion of processed text into numerical vectors using techniques like CountVectorizer.
- **Similarity Calculation:** Calculation of similarity between movies based on their attributes, typically using techniques like cosine similarity.
- **Recommendation Functionality:** System suggests movies to users based on the attributes of movies they have liked or rated positively. It analyzes similarities between movies in terms of genres, keywords, cast, and crew to provide relevant recommendations.

## Installation

To run the Movie Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the movie dataset (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`) or use your own dataset.
4. Update the file paths in the code to point to the location of your dataset.
5. Run the application: `python your_script.py`
